			<h3 id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
			<p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of
				raising them in
				comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of
				cultures around
				the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
				Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and
				boiling, among many
				others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become
				a staple of
				fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations
				of cholesterol
				and saturated fat
				The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across
				different parts of
				the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while
				less-developed
				areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be
				19 billion
				chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

			<h3 id="beef">Beef</h3>
			<p>Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained
				from early
				maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in
				colour and
				well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft,
				porous, and red;
				the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging;
				in one common
				aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical
				changes in the
				muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.
				Grading standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large international beef trade.
				In the United
				States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner.
				Commercial grades
				are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner grades are used in processed
				meat products.
				Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.
				The primary beef-consuming countries of the world (in per capita terms) are Uruguay, Argentina, New
				Zealand, Australia,
				and the United States. Beef is relatively scarce-and not particularly popular—in most of Southeast Asia,
				Africa, and the
				Indian subcontinent; the sanctity of the cow in the Hindu religion forbids the consumption of its meat
				by Hindu
				adherents. Beef is not unusual in the cuisines of Korea and Japan, however; in kobe, Japan, near Ōsaka,
				a highly prized
				beef is produced from cattle that are vigorously massaged and fed a liberal dietary supplement of beer.
				Butchering practices differ among countries, resulting in a variety of names for the different cuts. In
				the United
				States, where beef is the most popular meat, steaks—cross-sections from the fleshier parts of the
				carcass—are among the
				most desirable cuts. The standing rib roast, called in Britain the best rib, is also a valued cut. Less
				desirable cuts
				may be pot-roasted, used in stews, or ground (see hamburger). Boiled beef is popular in some cuisines,
				as in the French
				dish known as pot-au-feu. Corned beef (or salt beef in Britain) is a brisket or rump cut that has been
				pickled in brine.

			<h3 id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
			<p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt,
				accompanying a
				variety of ingredients (neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of
				sushi and its
				presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari or
				sumeshi
				Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
				short-grain rice.
				It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.
				Many types of
				sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon
				radish or pickled
				daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
				Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
				sliced raw fish, or
				occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
				Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi ("salted fish"), stored in fermented rice
				for possibly
				months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be
				discarded
				before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its
				Japanese
				consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated (shi)
				terminal-form conjugation,
				sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be sour";the overall dish has a
				sour and umami
				or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga
				Prefecture.
				Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the
				sake of enhancing
				both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar
				significantly increased the
				dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The
				primitive sushi would
				be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in
				this preparation,
				the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
				It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori.
